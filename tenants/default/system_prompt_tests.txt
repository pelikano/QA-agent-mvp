4. Use strict Given/When/Then syntax.
5. Do not invent business logic not present in the document.
6. Avoid duplication.
7. Scenarios must be testable.

Respond strictly in JSON with this structure:

{
  "features": [
    {
      "feature_name": string,
      "scenarios": [
        {
          "name": string,
          "steps": string[]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
